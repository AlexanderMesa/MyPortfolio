                  My name is Alexander Mesa. I was born in Goose Creek, SC in
                  1994 and moved to Cary, NC when I was nine years old. My
                  mother's name is Dalia, and my father's name is Wilfredo. I
                  also have two younger sisters: Claudia and Andrea. When I was
                  younger, I especially enjoyed math, science, and computers in
                  school, and that has not changed at all. The first computer
                  programming class I took in my junior year of high school was
                  Visual Basic. I also took C++ in high school, and it was a lot
                  of fun using the Xbox controllers to interact with the
                  programs that we made. I also took Java and HTML freshman year
                  of college. When it came time to select my major, I wanted to
                  incorporate my interests in math, chemistry, and computers,
                  which led me to choosing chemical engineering.

                <p style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px">
                  One of the other reasons why I picked chemical engineering was
                  because I wanted a major that required problem solving and
                  troubleshooting. I wanted something challenging and rewarding.
                  This degree provided me with the problem-solving skills that I
                  can transfer into almost any technical job. However, there was
                  not computer programming involved in this major. While it did
                  require high-level math, science, and computer skills, I only
                  learned two new languages in that major: MATLAB and Excel VBA.
                  I used them to solve multiple sets of differential equations.
                  I wanted to become more marketable and learn more about web
                  development than just basic HTML, so I enrolled in the UNC
                  Coding Boot Camp.

                  The UNC Coding Boot Camp is a full stack web development
                  course that lasts for six months. You spend about three weeks
                  learning about HTML and CSS, and you spend the rest of the
                  course learning about JavaScript. That is how deep JavaScript
                  is. This course is more than just making buttons, checkboxes,
                  and other items on a webpage interactive. This is front end
                  and back end web development. For the back end, I learned
                  about accessing Application Program Interfaces (APIs) from a
                  website and getting any data from that database. I also made
                  my own databases using MySQL and MongoDB with create, read,
                  update, and delete (CRUD) functionality. For the front end, I
                  organized the data on the webpage and had the CRUD
                  functionality for the user. I used Express.js for the server
                  side to establish the connection between the front end and
                  back end. Express.js also useful for organizing a website with
                  multiple webpages. At the end, I learned about React.js
                  library to make complicated websites run more smoothly.
                  jQuery, the primary JavaScript library used in this course, is
                  great for simple websites. However, for a complex website like
                  Facebook, jQuery would be too slow. In fact, Facebook
                  developed React, so we know who to thank for the smoothness of
                  the websites we have today. All in all, this is a fantastic
                  course if you have no idea how to make websites and are eager
                  to learn. I would recommend it to anyone.
