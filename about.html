                  My name is Alexander Mesa. I was born in Charleston, SC in
                  1994 and moved to Cary, NC when I was nine. My father is a
                  computer programmer, and my mother was an engineer. When I was
                  younger, I enjoyed math, science, and computers in school, and
                  that has not changed at all. The first computer programming
                  class I took in my junior year of high school was Visual
                  Basic. I also took C++ in high school and enjoyed using the
                  Xbox controllers to interact with the programs that I made. I
                  also took Java and HTML freshman year of college. When it came
                  time to select my major, I wanted to incorporate my interests
                  in math, chemistry, and computers, which led me to choosing
                  chemical engineering.

                <p style="margin: 30px 30px 0 30px">
                  Besides math and science, problem-solving and troubleshooting
                  were integral aspects of my major. It was a challenging but
                  rewarding degree that provided me with the problem-solving
                  skills that I can transfer into almost any technical job. An
                  engineering degree with solid programming background is a
                  powerful combination that will open up numerous career doors.
                  I learned MATLAB and Excel VBA in my major when I used them to
                  solve multiple sets of differential equations. However, I
                  wanted to expand my knowledge on programming to learn more
                  about web development, so I enrolled in the UNC Coding Boot
                  Camp.

                  The UNC Coding Boot Camp is a full stack web development
                  course that lasts for six months. I spent about three weeks
                  learning about HTML and CSS and the rest of the course
                  learning about JavaScript. This is front end and back end web
                  development. For the back end, I learned about accessing
                  Application Program Interfaces (APIs) from a website and
                  retrieving data from that database. I also made my own
                  databases using MySQL and MongoDB with create, read, update,
                  and delete (CRUD) functionality. For the front end, I
                  organized the data on the webpage and had the CRUD
                  functionality for the user. I used Express.js for the server
                  side to establish the connection between the front end and
                  back end. At the end, I utilized React to make complicated
                  websites run more smoothly. jQuery, the primary JavaScript
                  library used in this course, is great for simple websites.
                  However, for a complex website like Facebook, jQuery would be
                  too slow. In fact, Facebook developed React, so we know who to
                  thank for the smoothness of the websites we have today.

                  All in all, this is a fantastic course for becoming a full
                  stack web developer and learning about coding in general. I
                  would recommend it to anyone who is interested in programming.
                  I can transfer your coding skills from this class to other
                  programming languages. This course is great for any STEM
                  career. For instance, engineers may need to write a script to
                  automate a system to reduce redundancy. I will treasure my
                  education in college and in the UNC Coding Boot Camp and
                  hopefully combine the skills in a fulfilling career.
